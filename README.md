CAT201 Assignment 2: Create React App

A. Overview of the Project

Based on the task, we need to create a company website that could display company information such as company name, services, company background and so on. The main purpose of this task is to use ReactJS and NodeJS as the web development tools to develop the website. After a few discussions, we decided to create a website for a beauty and wellness company called ‘LuxeAura’. 

B. Company Description

The LuxeAura Beauty & Spa aspires to be a leading destination for complete beauty and wellness experiences. Its primary goal is to create a tranquil environment in which clients can indulge in spa services and discover premium ethical cosmetic products designed to enhance their natural beauty.
LuxeAura will provide a variety of spa services designed to promote relaxation, rejuvenation, and overall well-being as part of the project. Massages, facials, body treatments, and specialised wellness offerings are among the services provided. Aside from these services, the company will curate a selection of high-quality cosmetic products with an emphasis on ethical sourcing and sustainability. These products will be available for purchase in addition to the spa services, allowing clients to continue their wellness routine at home.
Hence, a website is designed to ease customers experience to know more about LuxeAura. On the website, various information about the company will be displayed starting from the services to the staff’s information.

C. Website Description

Our website is divided into five pages that display different information as the following:
•	Home Page:
This page was designed to display main information about LuxeAura that could visually attract the customers to explore the website more. There was a catchy phrase displayed on this page to grasp the customers’ attention and make the website more attractive. 
•	Services Page:
This page was created to display all the services offered by LuxeAura. There were pictures and prices attached to each service to make the page look more informative.
•	About Page:
This page was specifically designed to provide customers with the details of LuxeAura’s company background such as vision and mission, year of establishment and short company description.
 
•	Contact Page:
As a company that provides services, this page is compulsory for customers to provide feedback and complaints about our services. This page was designed to ease customers in giving their feedback and so on.
•	Staff Page:
This page was specifically created to provide information about staff information which is company’s executives.

Services, about, contact and staff pages then will be connected to home page as main page. All the pages can be accessed by clicking the page name on the navigation bar on the website header. Every page on this website has the same header and footer to make the website looks more interactive. The website can be accessed in two modes which were mobile mode and desktop mode. There would be slightly different between these two modes in terms of Graphical User Interface (GUI).
